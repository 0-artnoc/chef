### --run-lock-timeout for chef-client and chef-solo
You can now add a timeout for the maximum time a client run waits on another client run to finish.
The default is to wait indefinitely.
Setting the run lock timeout to 0 causes the second client run to exit immediately.

This can be configured in your config file:
```
run_lock_timeout SECONDS
```

Or via the command line:
```
chef-client --run-lock-timeout SECONDS
```

#### New knife command: knife node environment set
You can now easily set the environment for an existing node without editing the node object:

```
knife node environment set NODE ENVIRONMENT
```
