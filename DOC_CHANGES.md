### chef-zero port ranges

- to avoid crashes, by default, Chef will now scan a port range and take the first available port from 8889-9999.
- to change this behavior, you can pass --chef-zero-port=PORT_RANGE (for example, 10,20,30 or 10000-20000) or modify Chef::Config.chef_zero.port to be a po
rt string, an enumerable of ports, or a single port number.

### Encrypted Data Bags Version 3

Encrypted Data Bag version 3 uses [GCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) internally. Ruby 2 and OpenSSL version 1.0.1 or higher are required to use it.
