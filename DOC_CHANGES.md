This file is reset every time a new release is done. This file describes changes that have not yet been released.

Example Doc Change:
### Headline for the required change
Description of the required change.
-->

### Metadata `name` Attribute is Required.

Current documentation states:

> The name of the cookbook. This field is inferred unless specified.

This is no longer correct as of 12.0. The `name` field is required; if
it is not specified, an error will be raised if it is not specified.
