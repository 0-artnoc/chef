  # multiple end-user objects. Known use cases for now are configurable/pretty
  # Console output formatters and reporting data collectors.

  # Before making this "final" the API needs to be future-proofed by making the
  # higher arity methods take a single Struct object as input so we can add
  # fields in the future.
  #
  # Also. Should provide aggregate methods for file load/fail/complete, so
  # implementors can easily do the same thing for all/most file types.
