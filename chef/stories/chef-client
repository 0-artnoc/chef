Story: Applying a meal with chef-client

  As a systems administrator
  I want to configure a system
  So that I can drink more beer
  
  Scenario: The client should be rejected if the node is not verified
    Given the node 'latte'
    When it runs the chef-client
    Then it should register with the Chef Server
    
  Scenario: The node registers for an OpenID
    
    Given the node 'latte'
    When it runs the chef-client
    Then it should register with the Chef Server
    And CouchDB should have a 'openid_registration_latte' document
        
  Scenario: An administrator validates the OpenID Registration
    
    Given the user 'openid.hjksolutions.com/adam'
    And the openid registration for 'latte'
    When the user validates the registration
    Then the registration validation should be true
