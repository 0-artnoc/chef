= Chef

== DESCRIPTION:

Chef is a configuration management tool designed to bring automation to your entire infrastructure.

The Chef Wiki is the definitive source of user documentation.

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home

This README focuses on developers who want to modify Chef source code. For users who just want to run the latest and greatest Chef development version in their environment, see:

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+from+HEAD

== DEVELOPMENT:

Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to read the Opscode Contributing document.

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/opscode/Contributing

You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We document the process on the Chef Wiki.

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/opscode/Working+with+Git

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code. We do use TDD with RSpec, so you'll need to get a development environment running.

== REQUIREMENTS:

Ruby 1.8.7+ [1]

[1] As of 2012-05-25 Ruby 1.8.6 should still work, except for CHEF-2329.

== ENVIRONMENT:

In order to have a development environment where changes to the Chef code can be tested, we'll need to install a few things after setting up the Git repository.

=== Non-Gem Dependencies

Install these via your platform's preferred method; for example apt, yum, ports, emerge, etc.

* Git[http://git-scm.com/]
* GCC and C Standard Libraries, header files, etc. (i.e., build-essential on debian/ubuntu)
* Ruby development package

=== Runtime Rubygem Dependencies
==== Chef Client and Solo
* ohai
* erubis
* highline
* json (1.4.4 - 1.4.6)
* mixlib-authentication
* mixlib-cli
* mixlib-config
* mixlib-log
* moneta
* rest-client
* uuidtools
* merb-core
* net-ssh
* fog

=== Development Rubygem Dependencies
* rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org/]
* rspec[http://rspec.info/]

Ohai is also by Opscode and available on GitHub, http://github.com/opscode/ohai/tree/master.

== Spec testing:

We use RSpec for unit/spec tests. It is not necessary to start the development
environment to run the specs--they are completely standalone.

  rake spec
