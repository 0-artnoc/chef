Uses \fBgit\fR version control in conjunction with the cookbook site to download upstream cookbooks\. A new vendor branch is created in git, the cookbook downloaded from the site and untarred, then the master branch is merged\. This allows the user to track upstream changes to cookbooks while merging in customizations\. If \fI\-d\fR is specified, all the cookbooks it depends on (via metadata \fIdependencies\fR) are downloaded and untarred as well, each using their own vendor branch\.
